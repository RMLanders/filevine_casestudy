each shareholder the wynnes claimed the share of maxims income taxes that they paid as a credit against their maryland individual income tax which includes maryland state taxes and howard county taxes

of race was a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment in accordance with batson if a party can make a prima facie showing that preemptory challenges are being used in a

california resident until april 1992 and issued notices of proposed assessments and imposed substantial civil fraud penalties hyatt filed suit against cftb in a nevada state court alleging that cftb had committed negligence and intentional torts during the course of its audit cftb argued that the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because full faith and credit required that the court apply california law immunizing cftb from suit ultimately the nevada supreme court allowed the intentional tort claims to proceed to trial the court held that affording cftb statutory immunity with respect to intentional torts would contravene nevadas interest in protecting its citizens from injurious intentional torts and bad faith acts committed by sister states government

courts were not bound to grant the ftb full immunity\nat trial the jury found in favor of hyatt and awarded him over 300 million in damages the parties crossappealed to the supreme court of nevada

of hyatts move from california to nevada should be resolved via the administrative investigation ftb also asked the nevada supreme court to decide whether it was entitled to complete immunity under several theories it enjoyed complete immunity under california law it was entitled to sovereign immunity the full faith and credit clause and comity the nevada supreme court concluded ftb was not entitled to complete immunity under any of these principles but was entitled to partial immunity equal to the immunity a nevada government agency would receive thus the court concluded that ftb was

the peace and quiet of his community create pollution and increase crime the band intervened as a defendant at trial the secretary argued that the quiet title act qta precluded any person from seeking to divest the united states of title to indian land trusts hence because the bradley tract was in trust while patchaks suit was pending the district court did not have jurisdiction the court however

demonstrate that the statute was meant to benefit individuals in his situation pointing to portions of the ira tasking the secretary with considering affected members of the public before using his trust authority the court also rejected the secretarys argument that the qta barred patchaks suit reasoning that congress intended the qta to limit actions in which the plaintiff claims an interest in property contrary to the governments interest in contrast patchak did not seek sole possession of title to the bradley track therefore the court held that his suit fell within the general waiver of

the other defendants guilty and their convictions were affirmed on direct appeal\nnearly 25 years later turner and several of the other original defendants moved to have their sentences vacated and claimed that they had not received fair trials because the government had withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of brady v maryland which established that it was a violation of due process for

including the recantations of bennett and alston established that they were actually innocent of the crime the trial court denied the motion and the district of columbia court of appeals affirmed because turner and the other former defendants had not shown a reasonable probability that the outcome of their trials would have been different had the government disclosed the evidence in question and that the new evidence established their actual innocence by a preponderance of the evidence the supreme court consolidated this case with another suit by one of the other original defendants

contents\nthe jury found vasquez guilty on the charge of conspiracy but not guilty on the charge of attempting to possess cocaine\nthe us court of appeals seventh circuit held that vasquezs previous drug conviction was properly introduced into evidence the court rejected vasquezs claim that the polices search of the bonneville violated his fourth amendment rights noting that vasquez abandoned the car and that the police had probable cause to believe that the money for the drug transaction was in the bonneville the court also rejected vasquezs claim that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to elicit testimony through the crossexamination of agent chupik the trial court found the distinction between customers and customer to be trivial and the court held this finding to be within the trial courts discretion\nin a split decision the court turned to the testimony of marina perez holding that the evidence of conversations between marina perez and vasquezs counsel were properly admitted to show bias and inconsistency with prior statements while noting that the judge improperly instructed the jury that the recordings could be considered as evidence of the truthfulness of their contents it held this instruction to be a harmless error it pointed to other overwhelming evidence of vasquezs guilt including his attempt to escape capture and his previous conviction for drug dealing it held that the jury would have convicted vasquez absent the introduction of the transcripts and recordings in question\njudge david hamilton dissented on this point alone describing the recordings as prejudicial and inadmissible he reminded the majority that the error is only harmless if the court is convinced vasquez would have been convicted absent the error he used a different test than the majority looking to whether or not the error contributed to the conviction he noted that vasquez was never directly recorded or mentioned by name in any of the recordings and that government agents were not aware of his involvement until his arrest judge hamilton argued that marina perez testimony about vasquez was thus plausible evidence of innocence without the recordings on record","2476":"the general maritime law of the united states has long obliged ship owners to indemnify seamen against expenses of injury or illness suffered while on the job aboard ship
